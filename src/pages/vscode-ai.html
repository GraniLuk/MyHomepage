          <li><strong>Powerful AI Lineup</strong><br>
              With Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI’s latest models onboard, VS Code is catching up to Cursor with an AI toolbox that can help with everything from auto-completing code to offering smart refactors and code explanations. It’s like having three coding sidekicks in one IDE.

              This update lets VS Code users get the same cutting-edge AI benefits that Cursor users have been raving about, but with no need to switch editors.
