        <p>Big news! JetBrains Rider is now free for non-commercial projects. Here’s why that rocks:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Top-Tier Tools, Zero Cost</strong><br>
              No more scrimping on features! Students, hobbyists, and indie devs get access to Rider’s pro-grade debugging, refactoring, and code insights—no wallet required.
          </li>
          <li><strong>All-In-One Powerhouse</strong><br>
              With built-in Docker, Unity, and Azure support, Rider makes cloud, game, and .NET dev smoother and faster. More coding, less tool-juggling.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Cross-Platform Freedom</strong><br>
